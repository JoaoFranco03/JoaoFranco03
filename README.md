# üí´ About Me:
Hi üëã. I'm a second year student at a Bachelor on Computer Engineering at ESTG - Polit√©cnico de Leiria.<br>Since I was young, I have had a passion for Informatics, and for all the possibilities it brings us, and as such, I aim to expand my skills in the area, always aiming at the development of relevant and well-designed applications.<br>Lately, I've been studying Swift and SwiftUI, not only due to the recent expansion of the mobile market, but also because of my interest for the language and the iOS / macOS platform.
