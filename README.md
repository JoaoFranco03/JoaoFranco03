# Hi, I'm Jo√£o üëã:
I'm a final year student at a Bachelor on Computer Engineering at [ESTG - Polit√©cnico de Leiria](https://github.com/IPLeiria).<br>Since I was young, I have had a passion for Technology, and for all the possibilities it brings us, and as such, I aim to expand my skills in the area, always aiming at the development of relevant and well-designed applications.<br>Lately, I've been studying Swift and SwiftUI, not only due to the recent expansion of the mobile market, but also because of my interest for the language and the iOS / macOS platform.
